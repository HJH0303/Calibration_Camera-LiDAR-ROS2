# Camera-3D-LiDAR-extrinsic-calibration-ROS2
The camera and 3D LiDAR extrinic prameter calibration projects with ROS2 package.

## Getting Started
* You have to know your [camera intrinic parameters](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dbb/tutorial_py_calibration.html)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
